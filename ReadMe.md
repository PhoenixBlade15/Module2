First I will start with the specifications of the computer used for testing
    CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8C/16T 4.4GHz
    GPU: NVIDIA RTX 2060 Super
    Motherboard: MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon AC
    Ram: DDR4 3200MHz - 32 GB
    Monitor Resoultion: 2560x1440 @ 165hz

For all testing I used the MSI Afterburner benchmarker with everything being logged.

The first game that I tested was a game called "Hell Let Loose". The reason I chose this game is because my computer struggles to run it in some cases. From looking back at the logs my temperatures appeared to be fine. When looking at usage of the GPU and CPU we can see that the CPU is barely being worked while the GPU spikes to 60 sometimes, to me this says I may have to improve GPU to run the game better and that the game may be GPU heavy. This game was tested with all settings on low, and resoultion of 2560x1440.

The second game I chose was "Hunt Showdown" and looking at the logs for this game shows that the GPU is usually at 100% and the cpu is 25%, this shows that the game is GPU pegged and this is on the game at low, while the framerate is high and the only oddities is when the menu pops up. This game was also tested on low with resolution of 2560x1440.

The second test for "Hunt Showdown" was done in 1920x1080 all the other settings are the same as before. This shows that the GPU is the thing that needs to be improved before I see higher numbers.

The second test for "Hell Let Loose" is done all ultra settings, this game is intensive to run as shown by FPS but with a GPU upgrade again would improve greatly.
